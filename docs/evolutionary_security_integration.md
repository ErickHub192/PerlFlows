# Evolutionary Security Integration

## Overview

The Evolutionary Security Integration provides comprehensive security controls for the agent evolution system, ensuring that agent creation, mutation, and breeding operations respect security policies and maintain system integrity.

## Key Components

### 1. Security Manager (`EvolutionarySecurityManager`)

Central coordinator for all security aspects of agent evolution:

- **Validation**: Pre-validates all evolution operations
- **Monitoring**: Tracks agent behavior and performance 
- **Quarantine**: Isolates problematic agents
- **Rate Limiting**: Controls evolution operation frequency
- **Auditing**: Logs all security-related events

### 2. Security Profiles

Agents are assigned security profiles based on their specialization and performance:

- **RESTRICTED**: Minimal permissions, high oversight (fiscal agents)
- **STANDARD**: Normal permissions, standard oversight (most agents)
- **ELEVATED**: Extended permissions, medium oversight (data processing)
- **PRIVILEGED**: High permissions, minimal oversight (top performers only)

### 3. Specialization Constraints

Different agent specializations have different security requirements:

#### High-Security Specializations
- **SAT_FISCAL**: Max risk tolerance 0.3, restricted profile, human approval required
- **ACCOUNTING_FINANCE**: Same strict controls as fiscal agents

#### Medium-Security Specializations  
- **CUSTOMER_SUPPORT**: Max risk tolerance 0.5, standard profile
- **SALES_AUTOMATION**: Standard security controls

#### Lower-Security Specializations
- **DATA_PROCESSING**: Max risk tolerance 0.8, elevated profile
- **WEB_SCRAPING**: Relaxed controls for internal tools
- **API_INTEGRATION**: Standard data handling controls

## Security Validations

### Agent Creation Validation

Before any new agent is created, the system validates:

1. **Rate Limits**: Maximum 10 births per hour
2. **Risk Tolerance**: Must not exceed specialization limits
3. **Generation Limits**: Maximum generation varies by specialization
4. **Population Limits**: Maximum 10 agents per specialization
5. **Forbidden Mutations**: Some traits cannot be mutated for certain roles

### Mutation Validation

Before agent mutation:

1. **Parent Status**: Parent cannot be quarantined
2. **Violation History**: Parent cannot have excessive violations
3. **Mutation Intensity**: Limited to safe ranges (typically < 2.0)
4. **Specialization Rules**: Fiscal agents have stricter mutation limits

### Breeding Validation

Before two agents can breed:

1. **Quarantine Status**: Neither parent can be quarantined
2. **Violation History**: Low violation tolerance
3. **Specialization Compatibility**: Cross-breeding restricted for sensitive roles
4. **Combined Risk**: Average risk tolerance must be within limits

## Monitoring and Response

### Execution Monitoring

Every agent execution is monitored for:

- **Security Violations**: Unauthorized access, resource abuse
- **Performance Anomalies**: Excessive execution time, high failure rates
- **Behavioral Patterns**: Unusual request patterns

### Automatic Responses

Based on monitoring results:

1. **Minor Issues**: Trait adjustments (reduce risk tolerance)
2. **Moderate Issues**: Security profile demotion
3. **Serious Issues**: Quarantine with kill switch activation
4. **Critical Issues**: Emergency shutdown

### Quarantine System

Problematic agents are quarantined:

- **Immediate Isolation**: Agent is deactivated
- **Reason Logging**: Full audit trail maintained
- **Kill Switch Integration**: High-threat agents trigger system-wide alerts
- **Review Process**: Manual review before release

## Rate Limiting

Evolution operations are rate-limited to prevent system abuse:

- **Births**: 10 per hour maximum
- **Mutations**: 20 per hour maximum  
- **Breeding**: 5 per hour maximum

Counters reset hourly and are enforced across all evolution triggers.

## Integration Points

### 1. Agent Cloner Handler

Security validations integrated at:
- **Pre-mutation**: Validate mutation parameters
- **Post-creation**: Validate new agent meets security requirements
- **Registration**: Set appropriate security profile

### 2. Colony Manager

Security controls in:
- **Breeding Selection**: Only security-approved agents can breed
- **Natural Selection**: Security violations influence survival
- **Population Control**: Enforce security-based population limits

### 3. Bill Meta Agent

Security features in:
- **Task Analysis**: Consider security implications of task assignment
- **Agent Selection**: Prefer agents with good security profiles
- **Execution Monitoring**: Track security metrics during task execution

### 4. Marketplace

Security considerations:
- **Bidding Eligibility**: Quarantined agents cannot bid
- **Performance Tracking**: Security violations affect agent ratings
- **Task Assignment**: Security-sensitive tasks require appropriate profiles

## Configuration

### Default Constraints

```python
# High-security specializations
high_security = SecurityConstraints(
    max_risk_tolerance=0.3,
    security_profile=AgentSecurityProfile.RESTRICTED,
    forbidden_mutations=["risk_tolerance"],
    requires_human_approval=True,
    max_generation=5
)

# Standard specializations  
standard_security = SecurityConstraints(
    max_risk_tolerance=0.5,
    security_profile=AgentSecurityProfile.STANDARD,
    max_generation=7
)
```

### Rate Limits

```python
evolution_rate_limits = {
    "births_per_hour": 10,
    "mutations_per_hour": 20, 
    "breeding_per_hour": 5
}
```

## Security Events

All security activities generate events for auditing:

```python
@dataclass
class EvolutionSecurityEvent:
    timestamp: float
    event_type: str  # birth, mutation, breeding, violation, quarantine
    agent_id: str
    security_risk: SecurityRisk  # NONE, LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH, CRITICAL
    violation_details: Optional[Dict[str, Any]]
    action_taken: Optional[str]
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Regular Monitoring

- Check security dashboard daily
- Review quarantined agents weekly
- Analyze security trends monthly

### 2. Incident Response

- Quarantine suspicious agents immediately
- Investigate security violations promptly
- Update constraints based on lessons learned

### 3. Performance Balance

- Security shouldn't completely block evolution
- Balance security with innovation needs
- Regular review of constraint effectiveness

### 4. Audit Trail

- Maintain complete security event logs
- Document all manual interventions
- Regular security reviews and reports

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Too Many Quarantines**: Review constraint strictness
2. **Evolution Stopped**: Check rate limits and constraints
3. **Security Alerts**: Investigate agent behavior patterns
4. **Performance Degradation**: Balance security vs. performance

### Diagnostic Commands

```bash
# Check security status
curl /evolution/security/dashboard

# Review recent events
curl /evolution/security/events?limit=100

# Check rate limit usage
curl /evolution/security/rate-limits

# Get agent security profile
curl /evolution/security/agents/{agent_id}/profile
```
